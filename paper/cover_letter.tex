Dear Sir or Madam,
\vskip2ex
\noindent Please find enclosed our paper titled ``A formal mathematical
framework for physiological observations, experiments and analyses''
for submission to \emph{Nature Methods}. Our work, which uses
programming languages theory to model physiological experimentation in
a mathematical framework, solves two open problems in
neuroinformatics:

\begin{itemize}

\item \emph{ontology}: the organisation of data sharing requires a
  structure for representing a wide range of observations and
  contextual information. We propose a simple but flexible
  categorisation of physiological evidence.

\item \emph{data provenance}: by defining an experiment description
  language based on mathematical equations, we can unambiguously define
  the data provenance for experiments with physiological stimuli.
\end{itemize}

Although in this paper we have focused on physiology, we outline a
generalized theory and discuss its interaction with statistics. We
have validated this framework with two non-trivial experiments in
neurophysiology; one to measure visually evoked \emph{in vivo} spike
trains, and a dynamic clamp study of spinal neurons. This work has
serious implications for the scientific publishing on the semantic
web: our definitions \emph{cannot} be translated to common ontology
languages.

We suggest the following reviewers for our paper:

\begin{itemize}

\item Angus suggests: Boris Barbour, Hugh Robinson, Fabrizio Gabbiani
  Christoph Koch

\item Other possibilities: Jeff Diamond, Colin Runciman,
  Gerry Sussman, Ross King, Barak Pearlmutter, Ketil Malde, David Roundy

\item Exclude: can't think of any. 

\end{itemize}

\noindent Yours sincerely

\noindent Tom Matheson
