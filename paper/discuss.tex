\section*{Discussion}

We present an entirely new approach to performing and communicating
experimental science. So far, we have investigated and implemented this
approach for physiology, where we propose that three \emph{types} (signals,
events and durations), when parametrised by any other type, are
sufficient to represent most or all evidence for this field. We show
how observations and calculations of these types can be described in a
mathematical framework based on the lambda calculus. We use two
experiments from neurophysiology to demonstrate that this approach
works in practice: the \emph{in vivo} spike train response to a visual
looming stimulus in locusts; and a study of synaptic integration with
dynamic clamp. Our use of typed, functional and reactive programming
overcomes at least two long-standing issues in bioinformatics: the
need for a flexible ontology to share heterogeneous data from
physiological experiments \citep{Amari2002}, and a language for
describing experiments unambiguously \citep{Murray-Rust2002}. In
addition, the tradition of \emph{formal verification} attached to the
lambda calculus suggests the possibility that algorithmic procedures
can complement peer-review in validating scientific inference.

\subsection*{An ontology for physiology}

There are clear advantages to sharing primary data from scientific
experiments \citep{Insel2003} which include: preventing needless replication,
facilitating meta-analysis, giving theoretical neuroscientists access
to a greater variety of observations and enhancing transparency. These
benefits are likely to be greater if data are structured and stored in
standard formats. Despite these advantages, and many attempted
databases, little data from electrophysiological experiments are
shared in practise. This is likely due to both technical and social
barriers \citep{Amari2002}. We suggest that modifying the approach to
experimentation may help overcome social barriers by completely
integrating the experiment and analysis specification with structured
data storage that requires little annotation.

The types we have presented form a linguistic framework and an ontology for
physiology that address the technical barriers to data sharing. Thanks to the
flexibility of parametric polymorphism, our ontology can form the basis for
the interchange of physiological data without imposing unnecessary constraints
on what can be shared. The ontology in non-hierarchical and is difficult to
formulate in the various existing semantic web ontology frameworks (Web
Ontology Language or Resource Description Framework), which lack parametric
polymorphism and functional abstraction. Nevertheless, in specifying the
categories of mathematical objects that constitute evidence, it is an ontology
in the classical sense of cataloguing the categories of being within,
and providing a vocabulary for, a specific domain. We emphasise again
that it is an ontology of \emph{evidence}, not of the biological entities that
give rise to this evidence. It is unusual as an ontology for scientific
knowledge in being embedded in a \emph{computational} framework, such that it
can describe not only mathematical objects but also their transformations and
observations.

Existing software packages used for the acquisition and analysis of
physiological data have signal-like (Igor Pro, Wavemetrics; Spike 2,
Cambridge Electronic Design), and event-like (Spike 2) data structures
at the core of their operations. Although these package have some
flexibility in the information that can be carried by signals and
events, they do not exploit full parametric polymorphism: the range of
observations and stimuli that can be described with their more limited
definitions is smaller than in our framework. For instance, the signal
of shapes that describes a visual stimulus in Example 1, or the two-
or three dimensional location of a moving animal \emph{cannot} be
represented by a signal in these systems. In frameworks that can only
represent scalar signals, a location must be represented by two or
three separate signals. This is the case even if
``multi-dimesionional'' signals are permitted; this allows a value to
be \emph{indexed} by a vector, but the values themselves remain
scalar. This means that e.g. signals of locations cannot then be
packaged in a single value that can be manipulated by functions
written to transform signals. Full parametric polymorphism, on the
other hand, gives the possibility of creating a small vocabulary of
generic functions for data analysis. Therefore, our framework can be
seen as a generalisation of existing methods of physiological signal
processing.

Previous work on scientific knowledge representation has suggested
that ``meta-data'' can represent the context of an experiment
\citep{Bower2009}. This raises at least two questions: what
information must be communicated, and how should it be represented?
Minimal standards for reporting information from scientifc studies
have been suggested for different fields
\citep{Taylor2007,Gibson2008}, but remain informal. We suggest
distinguishing the experimental context into those aspects that can
practically be executed by a machine, and those that must be carried
out by a human experimenter. Machine-executable aspects of the
experiment can be described unambiguously; it is difficult to prove
that human-executable aspects can. Even if a description works well in
practice, there may be unstated shared assumptions between the
communicating experimenters. Informal but evolving reporting standards
are therefore likely to be the only way to delimit this information.

In terms of representing experimental contexts, here we make no
distinction between data and meta-data. All relevant information which
can be represented by values in some type can exist as a collection of
signals, events and durations. There are important reasons to believe
that there cannot exist a strict distinction between data and
meta-data. Information that seems incidental and contextual to the
experimenter may after dissemination become crucial and even a
manipulated parameter in subsequent studies. As an example, we point
to the effect of temperature on measurements of glutamate spillover in
the hippocampus \citep{Kullmann1996, Asztely1997}.  In our framework,
we do not impose any such distinction on information. That does not
imply that individual observations have no context. Because every
value has a temporal context, the relevant information about that
value can be retrieved by gathering other values with a similar or
enclosing temporal context.

\subsection*{Experiment descriptions}

Using the calculus of physiological evidence, both stimuli and
observations are defined concisely and unambiguously by mathematical
\emph{equations}. This makes it possible to repeat, manipulate and
reason about experiments in a formal framework. Our mathematical
definitions are less ambiguous than definitions written in plain
English, and are more powerful than those specified by graphical user
interfaces or in formal languages that lack a facility for defining
abstractions. Our approach also makes the conditions of the recording
very explicit, and can serve as an unambiguous medium for automating
and communicating experiments. 

Our framework is not only a theoretical formalism, but also a very
practical tool. It is a collection of computer programs for executing
experiments and analyses, and carrying out data
management. Controlling experimentation and analysis with programs
that share data formats is potentially highly efficient and eliminates
many sources of human error. Our experiment definitions have the
further advantage that they \emph{compose}; that is, more complex
experiments can be formulated by joining together elementary building
blocks. 

The use of a formal language for formulating experiments does not preclude the
use of a graphical user interface for helping to construct these formulations.
On the contrary, user-friendly interfaces can be built to primarily generate
code in language such as CoPE. This allows designers of innovative user
interfaces for experimentation and analysis to focus on that aspect, while
benefiting from an expressive, formally defined foundation; e.g., for
realising novel functionality, facilitate interoperability, not having to
worry about interacting with hardware in a timely manner as this is already
taken care of. Graphical user interfaces can also be an efficient way of
entering specific values based on the observed data. For instance, we have
used a simple interface to enter the thresholds for spike detection in Example
1. We plan to facilitate the description of such \emph{ad-hoc} interfaces and
also build more elaborate interfaces as front-ends to explore observations.

\subsection*{Statistics}

We have used the word ``evidence'' to mean direct observations and
calculated values from experiments. Evidence thus carries information
that is relevant for statistical models of the systems under study,
but we have not yet extended our approach to include statistical
analyses. How could values with signal, event or duration types be
incorporated into statistical models? A conservative approach would be to
take measurements on signals and events -- for instance the amplitude
of signal deflections, or the frequencies of event -- and store these in
durations. It would then be possible to use the tags of durations
representing measurements in classical null-hypothesis significance
tests such as the General Linear Model. 

A more intriguing possibility is to build statistical models for the
directly observed data \citep{Daniell1991}, and to use nested
durations to describe a hierarchical organisation \citep{Rouder2003}
of conditional dependencies amongst parameters in such a model. In the
context of physiology, this could be achieved by augmenting a
WinBUGS-like \citep{Gilks1994} language with constructors and
distributions for signals, events and durations.


\subsection*{Towards verified scientific inference}

If we consider that science is based on logic \citep{Jaynes2003}, it
must be possible in principle to mechanically verify scientific
inference, just as mathematical proofs can be verified by a proof
checker \citep{Harrison2009}. It is of course not possible to verify
particular hypotheses about the physical world, or an organism. What
might be verifiable are statements about experiments --- for instance,
that: particular variables were randomly controlled and not observed;
outcomes have not gained correlation due to the analysis procedure;
missing data are accounted for by the statistical model
\citep{Gelman2003}; errors are propagated correctly
\citep{Taylor1997}; units of measurement are used consistently
\citep{Kennedy1997}; there is no ``double dipping''
\citep{Kriegeskorte2009}; and ultimately, that the gathered data
support the conclusions drawn. Statistics addresses some of these
issues in relating observations to parameter estimation and hypothesis
testing, but every procedure makes assumptions about how the
underlying observations were obtained. Experiment description
languages, and the representation of experimental observations into
values of concrete types (which may not always be real numbers),
could play an important role in such inference. The statistical
framework within which such inferences take place has an impact on the
amount of information that must be analysed. For instance, if we
accept the likelihood principle \citep{Jaynes2003}, we can safely
ignore the intention of the experimenter, because all the relevant
information is in the likelihood of the observed data.

There has been substantial progress in \emph{automation} in the
experimental sciences \citep{King2004}. In contrast, there has been
almost no work in algorithmic verification \citep{Kropf1999,
  Sadot}, which is a separate but overlapping application of
calculating machines to science. Nevertheless, if such verification is
feasible it may lead to a radical change in the way scientific
research is conducted and communicated. It is likely that at least
some aspects of validation can be achieved with conservative
extensions of the calculus of physiological evidence integrated with
statistical inference.

\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Language implementation} 

We have used two different implementation strategies for reasons of
rapid development and execution efficiency. For purposes of
experimentation and simulation, we have implemented a prototype
compiler that can execute some programs that contain signals and
events defined by mutual recursion, as is necessary for many of the
simulations and experiments in this paper. The program is transformed
into a normal form that is translated to an imperative
program that iteratively updates variable corresponding to signal
values, with a time step that is set explicitly. The program is divided
into a series of stages, where each stage consists of the signals and
events defined by mutual recursion, subject to the constraints of
input/output sources and sinks. This ensures that signal expressions
can reference values of other signals at arbitrary time points
(possibly in the future) as long as referenced signals are computed in
an earlier stage.

To calculate a new value from existing observations after data
acquisition, we have implemented the calculus of physiological
evidence as domain-specific language embedded in the purely functional
programming language Haskell. 

For hard real-time dynamic-clamp experiments, we have built a compiler
back-end targeting the LXRT (user-space) interface to the RTAI (Real-time
application interface; http://rtai.org) extensions of the Linux
kernel, and the Comedi (http://comedi.org) interface to data
acquisition hardware. Geometric shapes were rendered using OpenGL
(http://opengl.org).

All code is available at http://github.com/glutamate/bugpan.

\subsection*{Locust experiments}

Recordings from locust DCMD neurons were performed as previously
described \citep{Matheson2004}. Briefly, locusts were fixed in
plasticine with the ventral side upwards. The head was fixed with wax
at a $90^{\circ}$ angle and the connectives were exposed through an
incision in the soft tissue of the neck. A pair of silver wire hook
electrodes were placed underneath the connectives and the electrodes
and connectives enclosed in petroleum jelly. The electrode signal was
amplified 1000x and bandpass filtered 50-5000 Hz, before
analog-to-digital conversion at 18 bits and 20 kHz with a National
Instruments PCI-6281 board. The locust was placed in front of a 22''
CRT monitor running with a vertical refresh rate of 160 Hz. All
aspects of the visual stimulus and analog-to-digital conversion were
controlled by programs written in the calculus of physiological on a
single computer.

\subsection*{Zebrafish experiments}

Intracellular patch-clamp recordings from motor neurons in the spinal
cord from a 2-day old zebrafish embryo were performed as previously
described \citep{McDearmid2006}. We used a National Instruments PCI-6281 board to
record the output from a BioLogic patch-clamp amplifier in
current-clamp mode, filtered at 3kHz and digitised at 10 kHz, with the
output current calculated at the same rate by programs written in the
calculus of physiological evidence targeted to the RTAI backend (see
above). The measured jitter for updating the output voltage was 6
$\mu$s and was similar to that measured with the RTAI latency test
tool for the experiment control computer.
