abstract = {We present a real-time simulation system that enables modeled dynamical systems to interact with physical experimental systems, and is specifically aimed towards execution of the dynamic clamp protocol. Model reference current injection (MRCI) operates under Real-Time Linux (RT-Linux or RTL) and provides a simple equation-oriented language for describing dynamical system models. Features include scripting of commands to implement repeatable protocols, the ability to output pre-computed waveforms through any variable or parameter of the model, the means to conduct time measurements and assess the computational performance of the real-time system, and an installation program that installs the software and accompanying device drivers with minimal input from the user. Tested models operate as fast as 30 kHz, with actual maximum rates dependent on model complexity. We present sample models that exhibit the main features of the modeling language. Experiments demonstrate the abilities of the system by creating a hybrid network of real and simulated neurons, and playing a pre-defined synaptic waveform into a synaptic conductance variable. We conclude by introducing a waveform reconstruction technique that is useful for establishing the presence of significant experimental error in implementations of the dynamic clamp protocol.},

abstract = {Given the complexity of microarray-based gene expression studies, guidelines encourage transparent design and public data availability. Several journals require public data deposition and several public databases exist. However, not all data are publicly available, and even when available, it is unknown whether the published results are reproducible by independent scientists. Here we evaluated the replication of data analyses in 18 articles on microarray-based gene expression profiling published in Nature Genetics in 2005-2006. One table or figure from each article was independently evaluated by two teams of analysts. We reproduced two analyses in principle and six partially or with some discrepancies; ten could not be reproduced. The main reason for failure to reproduce was data unavailability, and discrepancies were mostly due to incomplete data annotation or specification of data processing and analysis. Repeatability of published microarray studies is apparently limited. More strict publication rules enforcing public data availability and explicit description of data processing and analysis should be considered.},

abstract = {The articles in this special issue provide independent solutions for practical reproducible research systems. The use of Matlab-based tools such as the famous Wavelab and Sparselab packages in promoting reproducible research in computational harmonic analysis has been presented. In particular, the authors point to the success of the reproducible research discipline in increasing the reliability of computational research and reflect on the effort necessary for implementing this discipline in a research group and overcoming possible objections to it. An article also describes a Python interface to the well-known Clawpack package for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations that appear in wave propagation problems. The author argues strongly in favor of reproducible computations and shows an example using a simplified Python interface to Fortran code. An article also represents the field of bioinformatics, which has been a stronghold of reproducible research. It describes the cacher package, which is built on top of the R computing environment. Cacher enables a modular approach to reproducible computations by storing results of intermediate computations in a database. The special issue ends with an article on the legal aspects of reproducible research, including copyright and licensing issues.},

abstract = {Tony Hoare has always been a leader in writing down and proving properties of programs. To prove properties of programs automatically, the most widely used technology today is the ubiquitous type checker. Alas, static type systems inevitably exclude some good programs and allow some bad ones. Thus motivated, we describe some fun we have been having with Haskell, by making the type system more expressive without losing the benefits of automatic proof and compact expression. Specifically, we offer a programmer’s tour of so-calledtype families, a recent extension to Haskell that allows functions on types to be expressed as straightforwardly as functions on values. This facility makes it easier for programmers to effectively extend the compiler by writing functional programs that execute during type checking. Source code for all the examples is available at http://research.microsoft.com/simonpj/papers/assoc-types/fun-with-type-funs.zip.},

abstract = {Glycinergic and GABAergic excitatory chloride-mediated signaling is often the first form of activity to emerge in the nascent nervous system and has been proposed to be essential for several aspects of nervous system development. However, few studies have examined the effects of disrupting glycinergic transmission. Here we perturbed glycinergic transmission in vivo from the onset of development in zebrafish and examined its impact on the formation of the locomotor circuitry. Targeted knockdown of the embryonic glycine receptor alpha2-subunit disrupted rhythm-generating networks and reduced the frequency of spontaneous glycinergic and glutamatergic events. Immunohistochemistry revealed a reduction in the number of spinal interneurons without affecting sensory and motor neurons. This effect was accompanied by a concomitant increase in the number of mitotic cells, suggesting that glycine receptors regulate interneuron differentiation during early development. Despite the loss of many interneurons, a subthreshold rhythm-generating circuit was still capable of forming. These data provide evidence that glycine receptors, in addition to their role in neurotransmission, regulate interneuron differentiation during development of this central neural network.},

@article{Sadot,
abstract = {The last several decades have witnessed a vast accumulation of biological data and data analysis. Many of these data sets represent only a small fraction of the system's behavior, making the visualization of full system behavior difficult. A more complete understanding of a biological system is gained when different types of data (and/or conclusions drawn from the data) are integrated into a larger-scale representation or model of the system. Ideally, this type of model is consistent with all available data about the system, and it is then used to generate additional hypotheses to be tested. Computer-based methods intended to formulate models that integrate various events and to test the consistency of these models with respect to the laboratory-based observations on which they are based are potentially very useful. In addition, in contrast to informal models, the consistency of such formal computer-based models with laboratory data can be tested rigorously by methods of formal verification. We combined two formal modeling approaches in computer science that were originally developed for non-biological system design. One is the inter-object approach using the language of live sequence charts (LSCs) with the Play-Engine tool, and the other is the intra-object approach using the language of statecharts and Rhapsody as the tool. Integration is carried out using InterPlay, a simulation engine coordinator. Using these tools, we constructed a combined model comprising three modules. One module represents the early lineage of the somatic gonad of C. elegans in LSCs, while a second more detailed module in statecharts represents an interaction between two cells within this lineage that determine their developmental outcome. Using the advantages of the tools, we created a third module representing a set of key experimental data using LSCs. We tested the combined statechart-LSC model by showing that the simulations were consistent with the set of experimental LSCs. This small-scale modular example demonstrates the potential for using similar approaches for verification by exhaustive testing of models by LSCs. It also shows the advantages of these approaches for modeling biology.},

Protocols continue to increase in complexity as methods and technologies evolve and diversify. To encourage the standardized collection, integration, storage and dissemination of proteomics data, the Human Proteome Organization's Proteomics Standards Initiative develops guidance modules for reporting the use of techniques such as gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. This paper describes the processes and principles underpinning the development of these modules; discusses the ramifications for various interest groups such as experimentalists, funders, publishers and the private sector; addresses the issue of overlap with other reporting guidelines; and highlights the criticality of appropriate tools and resources in enabling 'MIAPE-compliant' reporting.},

abstract = {At excitatory synapses on CA1 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, a larger quantal content is sensed by N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs) than by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs). A novel explanation for this discrepancy is that glutamate released from terminals presynaptic to one cell can diffuse to and activate NMDARs, but not AMPARs, on a neighboring cell. If this occurs in the living brain, it could invalidate the view that glutamatergic synapses function as private communication channels between neurons. Here, we show that the discrepancy in quantal content mediated by the two receptors is greatly decreased at physiological temperature, compared with conventional recording conditions. This effect of temperature is not due to changes in release probability or uncovering of latent AMPARs. It is, however, partially reversed by the glutamate uptake inhibitor dihydrokainate. The results suggest that glutamate transporters play a critical role in limiting the extrasynaptic diffusion of glutamate, thereby minimizing cross-talk between neighboring excitatory synapses.},

abstract = {We have addressed the expression of long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA1 by comparing AMPA and NMDA receptor-(AMPAR- and NMDAR-) mediated postsynaptic signals. We find that potentiation of NMDAR-mediated signals accompanies LTP of AMPAR-mediated signals, and is associated with a change in variability implying an increase in quantal content. Further, tetanic LTP of NMDAR-mediated signals can be elicited when LTP of AMPAR-mediated signals is prevented. We propose that LTP is mainly expressed presynaptically, and that, while AMPARs respond only to glutamate from immediately apposed terminals, NMDARs also sense glutamate released from terminals presynaptic to neighboring cells. We also find that tetanic LTP increases the rate of depression of NMDAR-mediated signals by the use-dependent blocker MK-801, implying an increase in the glutamate release probability. These findings argue for a presynaptic contribution to LTP and for extrasynaptic spill-over of glutamate onto NMDARs.},

Knowledge about the origin and history of an image is crucial for establishing data and results quality; detailed information about how it was processed, including the specific software routines and operating systems that were used, is necessary for proper interpretation, high fidelity replication and re-use. We have drafted a mechanism for describing provenance in a simple and easy to use environment, alleviating the burden of documentation from the user while still providing a rich description of an image's provenance. This combination of ease of use and highly descriptive metadata should greatly facilitate the collection of provenance and subsequent sharing of data.},

abstract = {The development of in vivo brain imaging has lead to the collection of large quantities of digital information. In any individual research article, several tens of gigabytes-worth of data may be represented-collected across normal and patient samples. With the ease of collecting such data, there is increased desire for brain imaging datasets to be openly shared through sophisticated databases. However, very often the raw and pre-processed versions of these data are not available to researchers outside of the team that collected them. A range of neuroimaging databasing approaches has streamlined the transmission, storage, and dissemination of data from such brain imaging studies. Though early sociological and technical concerns have been addressed, they have not been ameliorated altogether for many in the field. In this article, we review the progress made in neuroimaging databases, their role in data sharing, data management, potential for the construction of brain atlases, recording data provenance, and value for re-analysis, new publication, and training. We feature the LONI IDA as an example of an archive being used as a source for brain atlas workflow construction, list several instances of other successful uses of image databases, and comment on archive sustainability. Finally, we suggest that, given these developments, now is the time for the neuroimaging community to re-prioritize large-scale databases as a valuable component of brain imaging science.},

We describe an implemented technique for producing optimizing compilers for DSELs, based on Kamin's idea of DSELs for program generation. The technique uses a data type of syntax for basic types, a set of smart constructors that perform rewriting over those types, some code motion transformations, and a back-end code generator. Domain-specific optimization results from chains of domain-independent rewrites on basic types. New DSELs are defined directly in terms of the basic syntactic types, plus host language functions and tuples. This definition style makes compilers easy to write and, in fact, almost identical to the simplest embedded interpreters. We illustrate this technique with a language Pan for the computationally intensive domain of image synthesis and manipulation.},

In this paper, we present a probabilistic language, called $\lambda$ο, which uniformly supports all kinds of probability distributions -- discrete distributions, continuous distributions, and even those belonging to neither group. Its mathematical basis is sampling functions, i.e., mappings from the unit interval (0.0,1.0] to probability domains.We also briefly describe the implementation of $\lambda$ο as an extension of Objective CAML and demonstrate its practicality with three applications in robotics: robot localization, people tracking, and robotic mapping. All experiments have been carried out with real robots.},

abstract = {Numerical computations are often specified in terms of operations on vectors and matrices. This is partly because it is often natural to do so; but it is also partly because, being otherwise useful, such operations have been provided very fast implementations in linear algebra libraries such as ATLAS (implementing BLAS), LAPACK, fftw, etc. Due to their better cache awareness and use of specialized processor instructions, a high-level invocation of an operation such as matrix multiplication using these libraries may execute orders of magnitude more quickly than a straightforward low-level implementation written in, say, C. The combination of efficiency and expressivity has made the framework of linear algebra an exceedingly popular one for scientists. For example, Matlab[1], an interpreter of a simple linear algebra language, has become a standard research tool in many fields.The process of expressing an algorithm in terms of matrices can be error-prone. Matlab and other popular matrix languages are dynamically-typed, which means that type errors are only detected at run-time. Even statically typed languages rarely keep track of more information in an object type than its tensor rank (e.g., to discriminate between matrices and vectors) and element type.If we could additionally expose object dimensions to the type system then we would ideally be able to detect a much wider variety of common errors at compile time than is currently possible. This would in turn make it easier to build and maintain larger numericsintensive software projects.We call our idea of exposing dimensions to the type system "strongly typed linear algebra". We have written a prototype implementation in Haskell, which is based on Alberto Ruiz's GSLHaskell[2] and which uses techniques from Kiselyov and Shan's "Implicit Configurations" paper[3].The presentation will cover the key aspects of our design such as the use of GADTs to combine matrix and vector types, and the use of higher-rank types and staging (namely, Template Haskell) to closely approximate a dependent-type system. Then, we will give a demonstration of interactive use, and compare our system to existing systems in the areas of speed and usability.},

abstract = {Spatially localized Ca(2+) domains are thought to play a key role in action potential (AP)-evoked neurotransmitter release at fast synapses. We used a stage-scan confocal spot-detection method and the low-affinity Ca(2+) indicator Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-5N to study the spatiotemporal profile of presynaptic AP-induced Ca(2+) domains. Families of scanned AP-induced fluorescence transients were detected from spot locations separated by 200-300 nm, within the vicinity of Ca(2+) entry sites. Typically, the largest transient in a particular scan peaked within approximately 1 msec and decayed with rapid (tau(1) of 1.7 msec) and slow components (tau(2) of 16 msec, tau(3) of 78 msec). As the spot was incrementally displaced, transients progressively exhibited a slowing in their time-to-peak and a loss of the fast decay component. Three-dimensional graphs of fluorescence versus time and spot displacement revealed the presence of AP-induced fluorescence domains that dissipated within approximately 7 msec. The size of fluorescence domains were estimated from the full-width at half-maximum of gaussian fits to isochronal DeltaF/F plots and ranged from 0.6 to 3.0 micrometer, with a mean +/- SD of 1.6 +/- 0.6 micrometer. Model simulations of a localized Ca(2+) entry site predicted the major features of the fluorescence transients and suggested that, within approximately 1 msec of the initiation of the Ca(2+) current, both the fluorescence domain and the underlying Ca(2+) domain do not extend significantly beyond the site of entry. Consistent with this prediction, the intracellular addition of EGTA (up to 2 mM) accelerated the decay of the measured transients but did not affect the domain size.},

abstract = {The Code Analysis Repository \& Modelling for E-Neuroscience (CARMEN) project aims to enable broad sharing of resources, through the provision of a secure, online environment for storage and curation of data, analysis code and experimental protocols, together with the ability to execute data analysis. While the CARMEN system is initially focused on electrophysiology data, it is equally applicable to many domains outside neuroscience. Metadata are essential for a system such as CARMEN that has the potential to store thousands of data collections and analysis codes; without metadata, resource discovery, interpretation, evaluation and re-use would be severely impeded. Therefore, when any resource (data, service or workflow) is added to the system, users must provide adequate descriptions. These descriptions form a metadata repository that is searchable to allow users to find any kind of resource held in the system, assuming that the user has appropriate access rights. This paper discusses and explores the project's approach to implementing such a metadata repository that meets both system requirements and user expectations. Initial approaches were refined after user evaluations, and a more practical approach was followed that better aligned with the aims of the users and the project as a whole.},

abstract = {Computational neuroscience is a subfield of neuroscience that develops models to integrate complex experimental data in order to understand brain function. To constrain and test computational models, researchers need access to a wide variety of experimental data. Much of those data are not readily accessible because neuroscientists fall into separate communities that study the brain at different levels and have not been motivated to provide data to researchers outside their community. To foster sharing of neuroscience data, a workshop was held in 2007, bringing together experimental and theoretical neuroscientists, computer scientists, legal experts and governmental observers. Computational neuroscience was recommended as an ideal field for focusing data sharing, and specific methods, strategies and policies were suggested for achieving it. A new funding area in the NSF/NIH Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCNS) program has been established to support data sharing, guided in part by the workshop recommendations. The new funding area is dedicated to the dissemination of high quality data sets with maximum scientific value for computational neuroscience. The first round of the CRCNS data sharing program supports the preparation of data sets which will be publicly available in 2008. These include electrophysiology and behavioral (eye movement) data described towards the end of this article.},

@article{Katz2010,
abstract = {The basic unit of any nervous system is the neuron. Therefore, understanding the operation of nervous systems ultimately requires an inventory of their constituent neurons and synaptic connectivity, which form neural circuits. The presence of uniquely identifiable neurons or classes of neurons in many invertebrates has facilitated the construction of cellular-level connectivity diagrams that can be generalized across individuals within a species. Homologous neurons can also be recognized across species. Here we describe NeuronBank.org, a web-based tool that we are developing for cataloging, searching, and analyzing neuronal circuitry within and across species. Information from a single species is represented in an individual branch of NeuronBank. Users can search within a branch or perform queries across branches to look for similarities in neuronal circuits across species. The branches allow for an extensible ontology so that additional characteristics can be added as knowledge grows. Each entry in NeuronBank generates a unique accession ID, allowing it to be easily cited. There is also an automatic link to a Wiki page allowing an encyclopedic explanation of the entry. All of the 44 previously published neurons plus one previously unpublished neuron from the mollusc, Tritonia diomedea, have been entered into a branch of NeuronBank as have 4 previously published neurons from the mollusc, Melibe leonina. The ability to organize information about neuronal circuits will make this information more accessible, ultimately aiding research on these important models.},

abstract = {The question of whether it is possible to automate the scientific process is of both great theoretical interest and increasing practical importance because, in many scientific areas, data are being generated much faster than they can be effectively analysed. We describe a physically implemented robotic system that applies techniques from artificial intelligence to carry out cycles of scientific experimentation. The system automatically originates hypotheses to explain observations, devises experiments to test these hypotheses, physically runs the experiments using a laboratory robot, interprets the results to falsify hypotheses inconsistent with the data, and then repeats the cycle. Here we apply the system to the determination of gene function using deletion mutants of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and auxotrophic growth experiments. We built and tested a detailed logical model (involving genes, proteins and metabolites) of the aromatic amino acid synthesis pathway. In biological experiments that automatically reconstruct parts of this model, we show that an intelligent experiment selection strategy is competitive with human performance and significantly outperforms, with a cost decrease of 3-fold and 100-fold (respectively), both cheapest and random-experiment selection.},

The system allows users to specify the names and types of channels to be sampled, and the calculations involved in reducing samples to breath-to-breath values. The specification of channels and calculations is given in EDL, an Experiment Description Language designed for respiratory physiology. EDL comprises a set of internal functions (primitives) which can be combined into arbitrarily complex expressions. To simplify EDL programming, TIDAL includes a macro processor and a standard macro library; the library contains definitions for a wide variety of respiratory variables. Examples are inspiratory and expiratory times and total volumes, mean inspired and expired gas volumes and concentrations, and end-tidal concentrations. Variables that are derived from these primary data, such as respiratory quotient, are also easily specified. TIDAL is written entirely in the C programming language, with special attention to portable coding practices. The code is organized in a modular structure that eases porting to multiple hardware/compiler/operating system environments.},

Ontologies are required to achieve this objective. A few subject-specific ontologies of experiments currently exist. However, despite the unity of scientific experimentation, no general ontology of experiments exists. We propose the ontology EXPO to meet this need. EXPO links the SUMO (the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology) with subject-specific ontologies of experiments by formalizing the generic concepts of experimental design, methodology and results representation. EXPO is expressed in the W3C standard ontology language OWL-DL. We demonstrate the utility of EXPO and its ability to describe different experimental domains, by applying it to two experiments: one in high-energy physics and the other in phylogenetics. The use of EXPO made the goals and structure of these experiments more explicit, revealed ambiguities, and highlighted an unexpected similarity. We conclude that, EXPO is of general value in describing experiments and a step towards the formalization of science.},

abstract = {The increasing use of high-frequency (kHz), long-duration (days) intracranial monitoring from multiple electrodes during pre-surgical evaluation for epilepsy produces large amounts of data that are challenging to store and maintain. Descriptive metadata and clinical annotations of these large data sets also pose challenges to simple, often manual, methods of data analysis. The problems of reliable communication of metadata and annotations between programs, the maintenance of the meanings within that information over long time periods, and the flexibility to re-sort data for analysis place differing demands on data structures and algorithms. Solutions to these individual problem domains (communication, storage and analysis) can be configured to provide easy translation and clarity across the domains. The Multi-scale Annotation Format (MAF) provides an integrated metadata and annotation environment that maximizes code reuse, minimizes error probability and encourages future changes by reducing the tendency to over-fit information technology solutions to current problems. An example of a graphical utility for generating and evaluating metadata and annotations for "big data" files is presented.},

The exchange of neuroscience data and tools between groups affords the opportunity to differently re-analyze previously collected data, encourage new neuroscience interpretations and foster otherwise uninitiated collaborations, and provide a framework for the further development of theoretically based models of brain function. Data sharing will ultimately reduce experimental and analytical error. Many small Internet accessible database initiatives have been developed and specialized analytical software and modeling tools are distributed within different fields of neuroscience. However, in addition large-scale international collaborations are required which involve new mechanisms of coordination and funding. Provided sufficient government support is given to such international initiatives, sharing of neuroscience data and tools can play a pivotal role in human brain research and lead to innovations in neuroscience, informatics and treatment of brain disorders. These innovations will enable application of theoretical modeling techniques to enhance our understanding of the integrative aspects of neuroscience.

abstract = {Neuronal gain control is important for processing information in the brain. Shunting inhibition is not thought to control gain since it shifts input-output relationships during tonic excitation rather than changing their slope. Here we show that tonic inhibition reduces the gain and shifts the offset of cerebellar granule cell input-output relationships during frequency-dependent excitation with synaptic conductance waveforms. Shunting inhibition scales subthreshold voltage, increasing the excitation frequency required to attain a particular firing rate. This reduces gain because frequency-dependent increases in input variability, which couple mean subthreshold voltage to firing rate, boost voltage fluctuations during inhibition. Moreover, synaptic time course and the number of inputs also influence gain changes by setting excitation variability. Our results suggest that shunting inhibition can multiplicatively scale rate-coded information in neurons with high-variability synaptic inputs.},

Stepping the membrane potential from a hyperpolarized level to a value in the neighbourhood of resting potential (-35 to -50 mV at 5 degrees C) results in an outward current transient, I(A), which is apparently carried by potassium ions.3. The peak amplitude of I(A) is dependent upon both the holding voltage level and the test step voltage while the time courses of development and decay are independent of, or only slightly dependent on, these parameters.4. The developing and decaying phases of I(A) are approximated by exponentials, leading to time constants for development of 10-25 msec and for decay of 220-600 msec over the aggregate of cells studied (data at 5 degrees C). Q(10) for the processes is approximately 3.5. It is concluded that the transport mechanism for I(A) is at least operationally distinct from the mechanism underlying delayed outward current, I(K).},

abstract = {1. We have developed a 19-compartment cable model of a guinea pig CA3 pyramidal neuron. Each compartment is allowed to contain six active ionic conductances: gNa, gCa, gK(DR) (where DR stands for delayed rectifier), gK(A), gK(AHP), and gK(C). THe conductance gCa is of the high-voltage activated type. The model kinetics for the first five of these conductances incorporate voltage-clamp data obtained from isolated hippocampal pyramidal neurons. The kinetics of gK(C) are based on data from bullfrog sympathetic neurons. The time constant for decay of submembrane calcium derives from optical imaging of Ca signals in Purkinje cell dendrites. 2. To construct the model from available voltage-clamp data, we first reproduced current-clamp records from a model isolated neuron (soma plus proximal dendrites). We next assumed that ionic channel kinetics in the dendrites were the same as in the soma. In accord with dendritic recordings and calcium-imaging data, we also assumed that significant gCa occurs in dendrites. We then attached sections of basilar and apical dendritic cable. By trial and error, we found a distribution (not necessarily unique) of ionic conductance densities that was consistent with current-clamp records from the soma and dendrites of whole neurons and from isolated apical dendrites. 3. The resulting model reproduces the Ca(2+)-dependent spike depolarizing afterpotential (DAP) recorded after a stimulus subthreshold for burst elicitation. 4. The model also reproduces the behavior of CA3 pyramidal neurons injected with increasing somatic depolarizing currents: low-frequency (0.3-1.0 Hz) rhythmic bursting for small currents, with burst frequency increasing with current magnitude; then more irregular bursts followed by afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs) interspersed with brief bursts without AHPs; and finally, rhythmic action potentials without bursts. 5. The model predicts the existence of still another firing pattern during tonic depolarizing dendritic stimulation: brief bursts at less than 1 to approximately 12 Hz, a pattern not observed during somatic stimulation. These bursts correspond to rhythmic dendritic calcium spikes. 6. The model CA3 pyramidal neuron can be made to resemble functionally a CA1 pyramidal neuron by increasing gK(DR) and decreasing dendritic gCa and gK(C). Specifically, after these alterations, tonic depolarization of the soma leads to adapting repetitive firing, whereas stimulation of the distal dendrites leads to bursting. 7. A critical set of parameters concerns the regulation of the pool of intracellular [Ca2+] that interacts with membrane channels (gK(C) and gK(AHP)), particularly in the dendrites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;This paper provides a statistical framework for estimating higher-order characteristics of the response time distribution, such as the scale (variability) and shape. Consideration of these higher order characteristics often provides for more rigorous theory development in cognitive and perceptual psychology (e.g., Luce, 1986). RT distribution for a single participant depends on certain participant characteristics, which in turn can be thought of as arising from a distribution of latent variables. The present work focuses on the three-parameter Weibull distribution, with parameters for shape, scale, and shift (initial value). Bayesian estimation in a hierarchical framework is conceptually straightforward. Parameter estimates, both for participant quantities and population parameters, are obtained through Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. The methods are illustrated with an application to response time data in an absolute identification task. The behavior of the Bayes estimates are compared to maximum likelihood (ML) estimates through Monte Carlo simulations. For small sample size, there is an occasional tendency for the ML estimates to be unreasonably extreme. In contrast, by borrowing strength across participants, Bayes estimation shrinks extreme estimates. The results are that the Bayes estimators are more accurate than the corresponding ML estimators.},

abstract = {1. The "descending contralateral movement detector" (DCMD) neuron in the locust has been challenged with a variety of moving stimuli, including scenes from a film (Star Wars), moving disks, and images generated by computer. The neuron responds well to any rapid movement. For a dark object moving along a straight path at a uniform velocity, the DCMD gives the strongest response when the object travels directly toward the eye, and the weakest when the object travels away from the eye. Instead of expressing selectivity for movements of small rather than large objects, the DCMD responds preferentially to approaching objects. 2. The neuron shows a clear selectivity for approach over recession for a variety of sizes and velocities of movement both of real objects and in simulated movements. When a disk that subtends > or = 5 degrees at the eye approaches the eye, there are two peaks in spike rate: one immediately after the start of movement; and a second that builds up during the approach. When a disk recedes from the eye, there is a single peak in response as the movement starts. There is a good correlation between spike rate and angular acceleration of the edges of the image over the eye. 3. When an object approaches from a distance sufficient for it to subtend less than one interommatidial angle at the start of its approach, there is a single peak in response. The DCMD tracks the approach, and, if the object moves at 1 m/s or faster, the spike rate increases throughout the duration of object movement. The size of the response depends on the speed of approach. 4. It is unlikely that the DCMD encodes the time to collision accurately, because the response depends on the size as well as the velocity of an approaching object. 5. Wide-field movements suppress the response to an approaching object. The suppression varies with the temporal frequency of the background pattern. 6. Over a wide range of contrasts of object against background, the DCMD gives a stronger response to approaching than to receding objects. For low contrasts, the selectivity is greater for objects that are darker than the background than for objects that are lighter.},

In addition, the parameters are generally poorly identified, akin to the well-known ill-conditioned problem of estimating a mixture of declining exponentials.

abstract = {Much of neuroscience has to do with relating neural activity and behavior or environment. One common measure of this relationship is the firing rates of neurons as functions of behavioral or environmental parameters, often called tuning functions and receptive fields. Firing rates are estimated from the spike trains of neurons recorded by electrodes implanted in the brain. Individual neurons' spike trains are not typically readily available, because the signal collected at an electrode is often a mixture of activities from different neurons and noise. Extracting individual neurons' spike trains from voltage signals, which is known as spike sorting, is one of the most important data analysis problems in neuroscience, because it has to be undertaken prior to any analysis of neurophysiological data in which more than one neuron is believed to be recorded on a single electrode. All current spike-sorting methods consist of clustering the characteristic spike waveforms of neurons. The sequence of first spike sorting based on waveforms, then estimating tuning functions, has long been the accepted way to proceed. Here, we argue that the covariates that modulate tuning functions also contain information about spike identities, and that if tuning information is ignored for spike sorting, the resulting tuning function estimates are biased and inconsistent, unless spikes can be classified with perfect accuracy. This means, for example, that the commonly used peristimulus time histogram is a biased estimate of the firing rate of a neuron that is not perfectly isolated. We further argue that the correct conceptual way to view the problem out is to note that spike sorting provides information about rate estimation and vice versa, so that the two relationships should be considered simultaneously rather than sequentially. Indeed we show that when spike sorting and tuning-curve estimation are performed in parallel, unbiased estimates of tuning curves can be recovered even from imperfectly sorted neurons.},

research, and although several algorithms for this purpose have
been successfully applied, their use has been limited by some
outstanding problems. The first is how to determine shapes of the

many shapes are distinct. A harder problem is that action
potentials frequently overlap making difficult both the
determination of the shapes and the classification of the spikes.
In this report, a solution to each of these problems is obtained by
applying Bayesian probability theory. By defining a probabilistic
model of the waveform, the probability of both the form and number
of spike shapes can be quantified. In addition, this framework is
used to obtain an efficient algorithm for the decomposition of
arbitrarily complex overlap sequences. This algorithm can extract
many times more information than previous methods and facilitates
the extracellular investigation of neuronal classes and of

This paper describes the use of the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and other Semantic Web technologies for the representation and integration of molecular-level data provided by several of SenseLab suite of neuroscience databases. METHODS: Based on the original database structure, we semi-automatically translated the databases into OWL ontologies with manual addition of semantic enrichment. The SenseLab ontologies are extensively linked to other biomedical Semantic Web resources, including the Subcellular Anatomy Ontology, Brain Architecture Management System, the Gene Ontology, BIRNLex and UniProt. The SenseLab ontologies have also been mapped to the Basic Formal Ontology and Relation Ontology, which helps ease interoperability with many other existing and future biomedical ontologies for the Semantic Web. In addition, approaches to representing contradictory research statements are described. The SenseLab ontologies are designed for use on the Semantic Web that enables their integration into a growing collection of biomedical information resources. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that our approach can yield significant potential benefits and that the Semantic Web is rapidly becoming mature enough to realize its anticipated promises. The ontologies are available online at http://neuroweb.med.yale.edu/senselab/.},

abstract = {No dendritic spikes occur in the input fan of the lobular giant movement detector (LGMD) neurone. The action potentials are initiated at the point of thickening of the axon, which therefore represents the site of convergence of the retinotopic projection in the MD system. Previous work has shown that the site of decrement in response to repetitive visual stimulation is distal to this point. No change in spiking threshold in the LGMD could be demonstrated, and decrement in the number of LGMD action potentials is completely explained by the observed decrement of EPSPs recorded in the LGMD input dendritic fan. Possible postsynaptic mechanisms which might affect EPSP amplitude are excluded experimentally or shown to be improbable. Latency measurements during electrical stimulation in the second chiasma (which produces a decrementing EPSP in the fan) indicate that the pathway from the chiasma afferents to the LGMD fan is probably monosynaptic. By exclusion, the site of decrement appears to be located at the presynaptic terminal of that synapse. Generalization of habituation of the response to ON and OFF stimuli is demonstrated, showing that the presynaptic neurone at the labile synapse is an ON/OFF unit. The greater part of the previously described sensitivity gradient on the retina, relative to the MD response, appears to be explicable by the geometry of the LGMD fan and of the retinotopic projection. We conclude that the LGMD is fed by a homogeneous population of ON/OFF units running in the second optic chiasma, which form labile synapses on the input fan.},

Action potentials in the descending contralateral movement detector neurone were taken as the indicator of response. 2. Over a range of at least six log10 units of adapting luminance, the MD system behaves as an ON/OFF unit, giving responses to both incremental and decremental changes in the illumination of a 5 degrees target. 3. With increasing amplitudes of stimuli, both the ON and OFF responses saturate rapidly. Saturation is reached sooner at higher levels of light adaptation. At all levels of light adaptation, the OFF response is greater than the ON. The ratio for saturating stimuli is approximately constant at around 3:2. 4. At the brightest adapting luminances used (20 000 cd/m2) the ON response is reduced but not lost. At the lowest (0-004 cd/m2) the OFF response to a 5 degrees disc fails, but can be regained by increasing the test area to 10 degrees. 5. From what is known of the retina of locusts and other insects, it is thought that light and dark adaptation in the MD system can be adequately explained by events at the retinula cell.},

abstract = {Grooming responses are movements of a multi-jointed limb that are targeted toward a stimulus site on the body. To be successful, they require a continuous transformation of stimulus location into a corresponding motor pattern or selection and blending of a subset of cardinal motor patterns. Tactile stimulation of one forewing of a locust elicits characteristic grooming movements of the ipsilateral hind leg. An initial targeted trajectory that moves the tarsus toward the site of stimulation is followed by a cyclic trajectory in the region of the stimulus. We have analyzed both components of this behavior to quantify the relative effects of somatotopic stimulus position and leg start posture on three parameters: initial movement direction, accuracy, and grooming distribution. Accuracy and grooming distribution were significantly affected by the stimulus location but were not influenced by the initial leg posture. Both cues systematically shifted the initial movement direction from the onset of the response. The subsequent cyclic component of grooming movements forms a behavioral continuum with no clustering in joint angle space. We therefore conclude that forewing grooming in locusts is generated by a single movement pattern that is continuously shifted by a sensory cue signaling position on the forewing surface. Both vertebrates and invertebrates can switch between distinct movement forms to groom different parts of their bodies. Our data provide the first evidence that invertebrates, like vertebrates, also have graded control of limb targeting within the somatosensory receptive field of a single form of motor response.},

abstract = {We demonstrate pronounced differences in the visual system of a polyphenic locust species that can change reversibly between two forms (phases), which vary in morphology and behavior. At low population densities, individuals of Schistocerca gregaria develop into the solitarious phase, are cryptic, and tend to avoid other locusts. At high densities, individuals develop instead into the swarm-forming gregarious phase. We analyzed in both phases the responses of an identified visual interneuron, the descending contralateral movement detector (DCMD), which responds to approaching objects. We demonstrate that habituation of DCMD is fivefold stronger in solitarious locusts. In both phases, the mean time of peak firing relative to the time to collision nevertheless occurs with a similar characteristic delay after an approaching object reaches a particular angular extent on the retina. Variation in the time of peak firing is greater in solitarious locusts, which have lower firing rates. Threshold angle and delay are therefore conserved despite changes in habituation or behavioral phase state. The different rates of habituation should contribute to different predator escape strategies or flight control for locusts living either in a swarm or as isolated individuals. For example, increased variability in the habituated responses of solitarious locusts should render their escape behaviors less predictable. Relative resistance to habituation in gregarious locusts should permit the continued responsiveness required to avoid colliding with other locusts in a swarm. These results will permit us to analyze neuronal plasticity in a model system with a well-defined and controllable behavioral context.},

Based on the stochastic search algorithm of Simulated Annealing (SA), it utilizes a kinematic body model that includes joint angle constraints to reconstruct posture from an arbitrary number of views. Rather than tracking marker trajectories in time, the algorithm minimizes an error function that compares predicted model projections to the recorded views. Thus, each video-frame is analyzed independently from other frames, enabling the system to recover from incorrectly analyzed postures. The system works with standard computer and video equipment. Its accuracy is evaluated using videos of animated locust leg movements, recorded by two orthogonal views. The resulting joint angle RMS errors range between 0.7 degrees and 4.9 degrees, limited by the pixel resolution of the digital video. 3D-movement reconstruction is possible even from a single view. In a real experimental application, stick insect walking sequences are analyzed with leg joint angle deviations between 0.5 degrees and 3.0 degrees. This robust and accurate performance is reached in spite of marker fusions and occlusions, simply by exploiting the natural constraints imposed by a kinematic chain and a known experimental setup.},

abstract = {Desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) can undergo a profound transformation between solitarious and gregarious forms, which involves widespread changes in behaviour, physiology and morphology. This phase change is triggered by the presence or absence of other locusts and occurs over a timescale ranging from hours, for some behaviours to change, to generations, for full morphological transformation. The neuro-hormonal mechanisms that drive and accompany phase change in either direction remain unknown. We have used high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to compare amounts of 13 different potential neurotransmitters and/or neuromodulators in the central nervous systems of final instar locust nymphs undergoing phase transition and between long-term solitarious and gregarious adults. Long-term gregarious and solitarious locust nymphs differed in 11 of the 13 substances analysed: eight increased in both the brain and thoracic nerve cord (including glutamate, GABA, dopamine and serotonin), whereas three decreased (acetylcholine, tyramine and citrulline). Adult locusts of both extreme phases were similarly different. Isolating larval gregarious locusts led to rapid changes in seven chemicals equal to or even exceeding the differences seen between long-term solitarious and gregarious animals. Crowding larval solitarious locusts led to rapid changes in six chemicals towards gregarious values within the first 4 h (by which time gregarious behaviours are already being expressed), before returning to nearer long-term solitarious values 24 h later. Serotonin in the thoracic ganglia, however, did not follow this trend, but showed a ninefold increase after a 4 h period of crowding. After crowding solitarious nymphs for a whole larval stadium, the amounts of all chemicals, except octopamine, were similar to those of long-term gregarious locusts. Our data show that changes in levels of neuroactive substances are widespread in the central nervous system and reflect the time course of behavioural and physiological phase change.},

abstract = {We characterized homeostatic plasticity at an identified sensory-motor synapse in an insect, which maintains constant levels of motor drive as locusts transform from their solitarious phase to their gregarious swarming phase. The same mechanism produces behaviorally relevant changes in response timing that can be understood in the context of an animal's altered behavioral state. For individual animals of either phase, different looming objects elicited different spiking responses in a visual looming detector interneuron, descending contralateral movement detector (DCMD), yet its synaptic drive to a leg motoneuron, fast extensor tibiae (FETi), always had the same maximum amplitude. Gregarious locust DCMDs produced more action potentials and had higher firing frequencies, but individual postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) elicited in FETi were half the amplitude of those in solitarious locusts. A model suggested that this alone could not explain the similarity in overall amplitude, and we show that facilitation increased the maximum compound PSP amplitude in gregarious animals. There was the same linear relationship between times of peak DCMD firing before collision and the size/velocity of looming objects in both phases. The DCMD-FETi synapse transformed this relationship nonlinearly, such that peak amplitudes of compound PSPs occurred disproportionately earlier for smaller/faster objects. Furthermore, the peak PSP amplitude occurred earlier in gregarious than in solitarious locusts, indicating a differential tuning. Homeostatic modulation of the amplitude, together with a nonlinear synaptic transformation of timing, acted together to tune the DCMD-FETi system so that swarming gregarious locusts respond earlier to small moving objects, such as conspecifics, than solitarious locusts.},

There is posture-dependence of motor neuron activity, which is stronger in large amplitude (putative fast) than in small (putative slow and intermediate) motor neurons. We relate this posture dependency to biomechanical aspects of the musculo-skeletal system and explain the occurrence of passive tibial movements that occur in the absence of agonistic motor activity. There is little recorded co-activation of antagonistic tibial extensor and flexor motor neurons, and there is differential recruitment of proximal and distal flexor motor neurons. Large-amplitude motor neurons are often recruited soon after a switch in joint movement direction. Motor bursts containing large-amplitude spikes exhibit high spike rates of small-amplitude motor neurons. The fast extensor tibiae neuron, when recruited, exhibits a pattern of activity quite different to that seen during kicking, jumping, or righting: there is no co-activation of flexor motor neurons and no full tibial flexion. Changes in femoro-tibial joint angle and angular velocity are most strongly dependent on variations in the number of motor neuron spikes and the duration of motor bursts rather than on firing frequency. Our data demonstrate how aimed scratching movements result from interactions between biomechanical features of the musculo-skeletal system and patterns of motor neuron recruitment.},

abstract = {To demonstrate the role of proprioceptive feedback in aimed limb movements, we induced graded changes in the signals provided by the principal receptor in a leg of a locust. The femoro-tibial chordotonal organ (FCO) of the hindleg monitors extension and flexion movements of the tibia and provides the main source of proprioceptive feedback about tibial kinematics. The FCO apodeme (tendon) was surgically shortened by different amounts to provide a systematic bias to this feedback, and aimed scratching movements were analyzed over the week after surgery. Shortening the apodeme led to increased firing of sensory neurons of the FCO at flexed joint angles and is thus functionally similar to flexing the tibia. Immediately after surgery, limb movements shifted dorsally and posteriorly, driven by overextension of the femoro-tibial joint and changes at other joints of the limb. The extent of tibial overextension reflected the extent of apodeme shortening. Overextension would tend to renormalize the FCO feedback signal and can be explained by known interjoint reflex pathways. Our data demonstrate that proprioceptive feedback provides a graded signal that is used to control these aimed limb movements. Over the course of 7 d after surgery, there was a functional recovery in aiming as the overall patterns of movement returned toward control values driven by reciprocal compensatory changes at two joints. The sensory to motor pathways are monosynaptic and oligosynaptic in this system, thus providing us with a powerful opportunity to investigate further the sensorimotor transformations and plasticity of aimed limb movements.},

abstract = {Desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) can transform reversibly between the swarming gregarious phase and a solitarious phase, which avoids other locusts. This transformation entails dramatic changes in morphology, physiology, and behavior. We have used the lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) and its postsynaptic target, the descending contralateral movement detector (DCMD), which are visual interneurons that detect looming objects, to analyze how differences in the visual ecology of the two phases are served by altered neuronal function. Solitarious locusts had larger eyes and a greater degree of binocular overlap than those of gregarious locusts. The receptive field to looming stimuli had a large central region of nearly equal response spanning 120 degrees x 60 degrees in both phases. The DCMDs of gregarious locusts responded more strongly than solitarious locusts and had a small caudolateral focus of even further sensitivity. More peripherally, the response was reduced in both phases, particularly ventrally, with gregarious locusts showing greater proportional decrease. Gregarious locusts showed less habituation to repeated looming stimuli along the eye equator than did solitarious locusts. By contrast, in other parts of the receptive field the degree of habituation was similar in both phases. The receptive field organization to looming stimuli contrasts strongly with the receptive field organization of the same neurons to nonlooming local-motion stimuli, which show much more pronounced regional variation. The DCMDs of both gregarious and solitarious locusts are able to detect approaching objects from across a wide expanse of visual space, but phase-specific changes in the spatiotemporal receptive field are linked to lifestyle changes.},

It receives excitatory input from an entire visual hemifield that anatomical evidence suggests is retinotopic. We show that this excitatory projection activates calcium-permeable nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In vivo calcium imaging reveals that the excitatory projection preserves retinotopy down to the level of a single ommatidium. Examining the impact of retinotopy on the LGMD's computational properties, we show that sublinear synaptic summation can explain orientation preference in this cell. Exploring retinotopy's impact on directional selectivity leads us to infer that the excitatory input to the LGMD is intrinsically directionally selective. Our results show that precise retinotopy has implications for the dendritic integration of visual information in a single neuron.},

We studied the biophysical mechanisms by which spike frequency adaptation shapes visual stimulus selectivity in an identified visual interneuron of the locust. The lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) responds preferentially to objects approaching on a collision course with the locust. Using calcium imaging, pharmacology and modeling, we show that spike frequency adaptation in the LGMD is mediated by a Ca(2+)-dependent potassium conductance closely resembling those associated with 'small-conductance' (SK) channels. Intracellular block of this conductance minimally affected the LGMD's response to approaching stimuli, but substantially increased its response to translating ones. Thus, spike frequency adaptation contributes to the neuron's tuning by selectively decreasing its responses to nonpreferred stimuli. Our results identify a new mechanism by which spike frequency adaptation may tune visual neurons to behaviorally relevant stimuli.},

The LGMD possesses a large dendritic field thought to receive excitatory, retinotopic projections from the entire compound eye. We investigated whether the LGMD's receptive field for local motion stimuli can be explained by its electrotonic structure and the eye's anisotropic sampling of visual space. Five locust (Schistocerca americana) LGMD neurons were stained and reconstructed. We show that the excitatory dendritic field and eye can be fitted by ellipsoids having similar geometries. A passive compartmental model fit to electrophysiological data was used to demonstrate that the LGMD is not electrotonically compact. We derived a spike rate to membrane potential transform using intracellular recordings under visual stimulation, allowing direct comparison between experimental and simulated receptive field properties. By assuming a retinotopic mapping giving equal weight to each ommatidium and equally spaced synapses, the model reproduced the experimental data along the eye equator, though it failed to reproduce the receptive field along the ventral-dorsal axis. Our results illustrate how interactions between the distribution of synaptic inputs and the electrotonic properties of neurons contribute to shaping their receptive fields.},

abstract = {We investigated in vivo the characteristics of spike-frequency adaptation and the intrinsic membrane properties of an identified, looming-sensitive interneuron of the locust optic lobe, the lobula giant movement detector (LGMD). The LGMD had an input resistance of 4-5 MOmega, a membrane time constant of about 8 ms, and exhibited inward rectification and rebound spiking after hyperpolarizing current pulses. Responses to depolarizing current pulses revealed the neuron's intrinsic bursting properties and pronounced spike-frequency adaptation. The characteristics of adaptation, including its time course, the attenuation of the firing rate, the mutual dependency of these two variables, and their dependency on injected current, closely followed the predictions of a model first proposed to describe the adaptation of cat visual cortex pyramidal neurons in vivo. Our results thus validate the model in an entirely different context and suggest that it might be applicable to a wide variety of neurons across species. Spike-frequency adaptation is likely to play an important role in tuning the LGMD and in shaping the variability of its responses to visual looming stimuli.},

abstract = {The lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) is an identified neuron in the locust visual system that responds preferentially to objects approaching on a collision course with the animal. For such looming stimuli, the LGMD firing rate gradually increases, peaks, and decays toward the end of approach. The LGMD receives both excitatory and feed-forward inhibitory inputs on distinct branches of its dendritic tree, but little is known about the contribution of feed-forward inhibition to its response properties. We used picrotoxin, a chloride channel blocker, to selectively block feed-forward inhibition to the LGMD. We then computed differences in firing rate and membrane potential between control and picrotoxin conditions to study the activation of feed-forward inhibition. For looming stimuli, a significant activation of inhibition was observed early, as objects exceeded on average approximately 23 degrees in angular extent at the retina. Inhibition then increased in parallel with excitation over the remainder of approach trials. Experiments in which the final angular size of the approaching objects was systematically varied revealed that the relative activation of excitation and inhibition remains well balanced over most of the course of looming trials. Feed-forward inhibition actively contributed to the termination of the response to approaching objects and was particularly effective for large or slowly moving objects. Suddenly appearing and receding objects activated excitation and feed-forward inhibition nearly simultaneously, in contrast to looming stimuli. Under these conditions, the activation of excitation and feed-forward inhibition was weaker than for approaching objects, suggesting that both are preferentially tuned to approaching objects. These results support a phenomenological model of multiplication within the LGMD and provide new constraints for biophysical models of its responses to looming and receding stimuli.},

They thus provide a good model to study the cellular and network mechanisms underlying the sensitivity to this specific class of behaviorally relevant stimuli. We determined over an entire locust eye the density distribution of optical axes describing the spatial organization of local inputs to the visual system and compared it with the sensitivity distribution of the LGMD/DCMD to local motion stimuli. The density of optical axes peaks in the equatorial region of the frontal eye. Local motion sensitivity, however, peaks in the equatorial region of the caudolateral visual field and only correlates positively with the dorso-ventral density of optical axes. On local stimulation, both the velocity tuning and the response latency of the LGMD/DCMD depend on stimulus position within the visual field. Spatial and temporal integration experiments in which several local motion stimuli were activated either simultaneously or at fixed delays reveal that the LGMD processes local motion in a strongly sublinear way. Thus the neuron's integration properties seem to depend on several factors including its dendritic morphology, the local characteristics of afferent fiber inputs, and inhibition mediated by different pathways or by voltage-gated conductances. Our study shows that the selectivity of this looming sensitive neuron to approaching objects relies on more complex biophysical mechanisms than previously thought.},

Recent work on an identified neuron in the locust visual system (the LGMD neuron) that responds well to objects looming on a collision course towards the animal suggests that this cell represents a good model to investigate the biophysical basis of multiplication and invariance at the single neuron level. Experimental and theoretical results are consistent with multiplication being implemented by subtraction of two logarithmic terms followed by exponentiation via active membrane conductances, according to a x 1/b = exp(log(a) - log(b)). Invariance appears to be in part due to non-linear integration of synaptic inputs within the dendritic tree of this neuron.},

We investigated an identified neuron (the lobula giant movement detector, LGMD, of locusts) whose output firing rate in response to looming visual stimuli has been described by two models, one of which involves a multiplication. In this model, the LGMD multiplies postsynaptically two inputs (one excitatory, one inhibitory) that converge onto its dendritic tree; in the other model, inhibition is presynaptic to the LGMD. By using selective activation and inactivation of pre- and postsynaptic inhibition, we show that postsynaptic inhibition has a predominant role, suggesting that multiplication is implemented within the neuron itself. Our pharmacological experiments and measurements of firing rate versus membrane potential also reveal that sodium channels act both to advance the response of the LGMD in time and to map membrane potential to firing rate in a nearly exponential manner. These results are consistent with an implementation of multiplication based on dendritic subtraction of two converging inputs encoded logarithmically, followed by exponentiation through active membrane conductances.},

The neuron's responses could be described simply by multiplying the velocity of the image edge (dtheta/dtau) with an exponential function of the size of the object's image on the retina (e-alpha theta). Because this product peaks before the image reaches its maximum size during approach, this neuron can anticipate collision. The neuron's activity peaks approximately when the approaching object reaches a certain angular size.

@article{Ioannidis2005,
abstract = {There is increasing concern that most 
current published research fi ndings are 
false. The probability that a research claim 
is true may depend on study power and 
bias, the number of other studies on the 
same question, and, importantly, the ratio 
of true to no relationships among the 
relationships probed in each scientifi c 
fi eld. In this framework, a research fi nding 
is less likely to be true when the studies 
conducted in a fi eld are smaller; when 
effect sizes are smaller; when there is a 
greater number and lesser preselection 
of tested relationships; where there is 
greater fl exibility in designs, defi nitions, 
outcomes, and analytical modes; when 
there is greater fi nancial and other 
interest and prejudice; and when more 
teams are involved in a scientifi c fi eld 
in chase of statistical signifi cance. 
Simulations show that for most study 
designs and settings, it is more likely for 
a research claim to be false than true. 
Moreover, for many current scientifi c 
fi elds, claimed research fi ndings may 
often be simply accurate measures of the 
prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the 
implications of these problems for the 
conduct and interpretation of research.},

@article{Elliott1997,
abstract = {Fran (Functional Reactive Animation) is a collection of data types and functions for composing richly interactive, multimedia animations. The key ideas in Fran are its notions of behaviors and events. Behaviors are time-varying, reactive values, while events are sets of arbitrarily complex conditions, carrying possibly rich information. Most traditional values can be treated as behaviors, and when images are thus treated, they become animations. Although these notions are captured as data types rather than a programming language, we provide them with a denotational semantics, including a proper treatment of real time, to guide reasoning and implementation. A method to effectively and efficiently perform event detection using interval analysis is also described, which relies on the partial information structure on the domain of event times. Fran has been implemented in Hugs, yielding surprisingly good performance for an interpreter-based system. Several examples are given, including the ability to describe physical phenomena involving gravity, springs, velocity, acceleration, etc. using ordinary differential equations.},

@article{Nilsson2002,
abstract = {Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) extends a host programming language with a notion of time flow. Arrowized FRP (AFRP) is a version of FRP embedded in Haskell based on the arrow combinators. AFRP is a powerful synchronous dataflow programming language with hybrid modeling capabilities, combining advanced synchronous dataflow features with the higher-order lazy functional abstractions of Haskell. In this paper, we describe the AFRP programming style and our Haskell-based implementation. Of particular interest are the AFRP combinators that support dynamic collections and continuation-based switching. We show how these combinators can be used to express systems with an evolving structure that are difficult to model in more traditional dataflow languages.},

States and operators are functional objects, and their semantics is defined --- as far as possible --- independently of the base in the Hilbert space. We construct effectively the tensor states for composed systems, and we present a toy model of quantum circuit toolbox. We conclude that functional languages are right tools for formal computations in quantum physics. The paper focuses mainly on the representation, not on computational problems.},

@article{Kriegeskorte2009,
abstract = {A neuroscientific experiment typically generates a large amount of data, of which only a small fraction is analyzed in detail and presented in a publication. However, selection among noisy measurements can render circular an otherwise appropriate analysis and invalidate results. Here we argue that systems neuroscience needs to adjust some widespread practices to avoid the circularity that can arise from selection. In particular, 'double dipping', the use of the same dataset for selection and selective analysis, will give distorted descriptive statistics and invalid statistical inference whenever the results statistics are not inherently independent of the selection criteria under the null hypothesis. To demonstrate the problem, we apply widely used analyses to noise data known to not contain the experimental effects in question. Spurious effects can appear in the context of both univariate activation analysis and multivariate pattern-information analysis. We suggest a policy for avoiding circularity.},
