Substitution [x := N ] is only performed in the free occurrences of x: yx(x:x)[x := N ]  yN(x:x):  In calculus there is a similar variable binding. In  R  b a  f(x; y)dx the variable x is bound and y is free. It does not make sense to substitute 7 for x:  R  b a  f(7; y)d7;  but substitution for y makes sense:  R  b a  f(x; 7)dx. For reasons of hygiene it will always be assumed that the bound variables that occur in a certain expression are dierent from the free ones. This can be fullled by renaming bound variables. E.g. x:x becomes y:y. Indeed, these expressions act the same way: (x:x)a = a = (y:y)a and in fact they denote the same intended algorithm. Therefore expressions that dier only in the names of bound variables are identied.  8 Introduction to Lambda Calculus Functions of more arguments  Functions of several arguments can be obtained by iteration of applica...},

abstract = {Grooming responses are movements of a multi-jointed limb that are targeted toward a stimulus site on the body. To be successful, they require a continuous transformation of stimulus location into a corresponding motor pattern or selection and blending of a subset of cardinal motor patterns. Tactile stimulation of one forewing of a locust elicits characteristic grooming movements of the ipsilateral hind leg. An initial targeted trajectory that moves the tarsus toward the site of stimulation is followed by a cyclic trajectory in the region of the stimulus. We have analyzed both components of this behavior to quantify the relative effects of somatotopic stimulus position and leg start posture on three parameters: initial movement direction, accuracy, and grooming distribution. Accuracy and grooming distribution were significantly affected by the stimulus location but were not influenced by the initial leg posture. Both cues systematically shifted the initial movement direction from the onset of the response. The subsequent cyclic component of grooming movements forms a behavioral continuum with no clustering in joint angle space. We therefore conclude that forewing grooming in locusts is generated by a single movement pattern that is continuously shifted by a sensory cue signaling position on the forewing surface. Both vertebrates and invertebrates can switch between distinct movement forms to groom different parts of their bodies. Our data provide the first evidence that invertebrates, like vertebrates, also have graded control of limb targeting within the somatosensory receptive field of a single form of motor response.},

abstract = {Fran (Functional Reactive Animation) is a collection of data types and functions for composing richly interactive, multimedia animations. The key ideas in Fran are its notions of behaviors and events. Behaviors are time-varying, reactive values, while events are sets of arbitrarily complex conditions, carrying possibly rich information. Most traditional values can be treated as behaviors, and when images are thus treated, they become animations. Although these notions are captured as data types rather than a programming language, we provide them with a denotational semantics, including a proper treatment of real time, to guide reasoning and implementation. A method to effectively and efficiently perform event detection using interval analysis is also described, which relies on the partial information structure on the domain of event times. Fran has been implemented in Hugs, yielding surprisingly good performance for an interpreter-based system. Several examples are given, including the ability to describe physical phenomena involving gravity, springs, velocity, acceleration, etc. using ordinary differential equations.},

abstract = {The lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) is an identified neuron in the locust visual system that responds preferentially to objects approaching on a collision course with the animal. For such looming stimuli, the LGMD firing rate gradually increases, peaks, and decays toward the end of approach. The LGMD receives both excitatory and feed-forward inhibitory inputs on distinct branches of its dendritic tree, but little is known about the contribution of feed-forward inhibition to its response properties. We used picrotoxin, a chloride channel blocker, to selectively block feed-forward inhibition to the LGMD. We then computed differences in firing rate and membrane potential between control and picrotoxin conditions to study the activation of feed-forward inhibition. For looming stimuli, a significant activation of inhibition was observed early, as objects exceeded on average approximately 23 degrees in angular extent at the retina. Inhibition then increased in parallel with excitation over the remainder of approach trials. Experiments in which the final angular size of the approaching objects was systematically varied revealed that the relative activation of excitation and inhibition remains well balanced over most of the course of looming trials. Feed-forward inhibition actively contributed to the termination of the response to approaching objects and was particularly effective for large or slowly moving objects. Suddenly appearing and receding objects activated excitation and feed-forward inhibition nearly simultaneously, in contrast to looming stimuli. Under these conditions, the activation of excitation and feed-forward inhibition was weaker than for approaching objects, suggesting that both are preferentially tuned to approaching objects. These results support a phenomenological model of multiplication within the LGMD and provide new constraints for biophysical models of its responses to looming and receding stimuli.},

abstract = {We investigated in vivo the characteristics of spike-frequency adaptation and the intrinsic membrane properties of an identified, looming-sensitive interneuron of the locust optic lobe, the lobula giant movement detector (LGMD). The LGMD had an input resistance of 4-5 MOmega, a membrane time constant of about 8 ms, and exhibited inward rectification and rebound spiking after hyperpolarizing current pulses. Responses to depolarizing current pulses revealed the neuron's intrinsic bursting properties and pronounced spike-frequency adaptation. The characteristics of adaptation, including its time course, the attenuation of the firing rate, the mutual dependency of these two variables, and their dependency on injected current, closely followed the predictions of a model first proposed to describe the adaptation of cat visual cortex pyramidal neurons in vivo. Our results thus validate the model in an entirely different context and suggest that it might be applicable to a wide variety of neurons across species. Spike-frequency adaptation is likely to play an important role in tuning the LGMD and in shaping the variability of its responses to visual looming stimuli.},

abstract = {Multiplicative operations and invariance of neuronal responses are thought to play important roles in the processing of neural information in many sensory systems. Yet the biophysical mechanisms that underlie both multiplication and invariance of neuronal responses in vivo, either at the single cell or at the network level, remain to a large extent unknown. Recent work on an identified neuron in the locust visual system (the LGMD neuron) that responds well to objects looming on a collision course towards the animal suggests that this cell represents a good model to investigate the biophysical basis of multiplication and invariance at the single neuron level. Experimental and theoretical results are consistent with multiplication being implemented by subtraction of two logarithmic terms followed by exponentiation via active membrane conductances, according to a x 1/b = exp(log(a) - log(b)). Invariance appears to be in part due to non-linear integration of synaptic inputs within the dendritic tree of this neuron.},

abstract = {Multiplicative operations are important in sensory processing, but their biophysical implementation remains largely unknown. We investigated an identified neuron (the lobula giant movement detector, LGMD, of locusts) whose output firing rate in response to looming visual stimuli has been described by two models, one of which involves a multiplication. In this model, the LGMD multiplies postsynaptically two inputs (one excitatory, one inhibitory) that converge onto its dendritic tree; in the other model, inhibition is presynaptic to the LGMD. By using selective activation and inactivation of pre- and postsynaptic inhibition, we show that postsynaptic inhibition has a predominant role, suggesting that multiplication is implemented within the neuron itself. Our pharmacological experiments and measurements of firing rate versus membrane potential also reveal that sodium channels act both to advance the response of the LGMD in time and to map membrane potential to firing rate in a nearly exponential manner. These results are consistent with an implementation of multiplication based on dendritic subtraction of two converging inputs encoded logarithmically, followed by exponentiation through active membrane conductances.},

In addition, the parameters are generally poorly identified, akin to the well-known ill-conditioned problem of estimating a mixture of declining exponentials. Our modeling includes (1) hierarchical population modeling as in Wakefield (1994), which allows partial pooling of information among different experimental subjects; (2) a pharmacokinetic model including compartments for well-perfused tissues, poorly-perfused tissues, fat, and the liver; and (3) informative prior distributions for population parameters, which is possible be-    Sch...},

A wide-field, movement-sensitive visual neuron in the brain of the locust was studied by presenting simulated approaching, receding, and translating objects. The neuron's responses could be described simply by multiplying the velocity of the image edge (dtheta/dtau) with an exponential function of the size of the object's image on the retina (e-alpha theta). Because this product peaks before the image reaches its maximum size during approach, this neuron can anticipate collision. The neuron's activity peaks approximately when the approaching object reaches a certain angular size. Because this neuron receives distinct inputs about image size and velocity, the dendritic tree of a single neuron may function as a biophysical device that can carry out a multiplication of two independent input signals.},

abstract = {The lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) in the locust visual system and its target neuron, the descending contralateral movement detector (DCMD), respond to approaching objects looming on a collision course with the animal. They thus provide a good model to study the cellular and network mechanisms underlying the sensitivity to this specific class of behaviorally relevant stimuli. We determined over an entire locust eye the density distribution of optical axes describing the spatial organization of local inputs to the visual system and compared it with the sensitivity distribution of the LGMD/DCMD to local motion stimuli. The density of optical axes peaks in the equatorial region of the frontal eye. Local motion sensitivity, however, peaks in the equatorial region of the caudolateral visual field and only correlates positively with the dorso-ventral density of optical axes. On local stimulation, both the velocity tuning and the response latency of the LGMD/DCMD depend on stimulus position within the visual field. Spatial and temporal integration experiments in which several local motion stimuli were activated either simultaneously or at fixed delays reveal that the LGMD processes local motion in a strongly sublinear way. Thus the neuron's integration properties seem to depend on several factors including its dendritic morphology, the local characteristics of afferent fiber inputs, and inhibition mediated by different pathways or by voltage-gated conductances. Our study shows that the selectivity of this looming sensitive neuron to approaching objects relies on more complex biophysical mechanisms than previously thought.},

abstract = {A neuroscientific experiment typically generates a large amount of data, of which only a small fraction is analyzed in detail and presented in a publication. However, selection among noisy measurements can render circular an otherwise appropriate analysis and invalidate results. Here we argue that systems neuroscience needs to adjust some widespread practices to avoid the circularity that can arise from selection. In particular, 'double dipping', the use of the same dataset for selection and selective analysis, will give distorted descriptive statistics and invalid statistical inference whenever the results statistics are not inherently independent of the selection criteria under the null hypothesis. To demonstrate the problem, we apply widely used analyses to noise data known to not contain the experimental effects in question. Spurious effects can appear in the context of both univariate activation analysis and multivariate pattern-information analysis. We suggest a policy for avoiding circularity.},

Measuring the activity of individual neurons accurately can be difficult due to large amounts of background noise and the difficulty in distinguishing the action potentials of one neuron from those of others in the local area. This article reviews algorithms and methods for detecting and classifying action potentials, a problem commonly referred to as spike sorting. The article first discusses the challenges of measuring neural activity and the basic issues of signal detection and classification. It reviews and illustrates algorithms and techniques that have been applied to many of the problems in spike sorting and discusses the advantages and limitations of each and the applicability of these methods for different types of experimental demands. The article is written both for the physiologist wanting to use simple methods that will improve experimental yield and minimize the selection biases of traditional techniques and for those who want to apply or extend more sophisticated algorithms to meet new experimental challenges.},

abstract = {Identifying and classifying action potential shapes in
extracellular neural waveforms have long been the subject of
research, and although several algorithms for this purpose have
been successfully applied, their use has been limited by some
outstanding problems. The first is how to determine shapes of the
action potentials in the waveform and, second, how to decide how
many shapes are distinct. A harder problem is that action
potentials frequently overlap making difficult both the
determination of the shapes and the classification of the spikes.
In this report, a solution to each of these problems is obtained by
applying Bayesian probability theory. By defining a probabilistic
model of the waveform, the probability of both the form and number
of spike shapes can be quantified. In addition, this framework is
used to obtain an efficient algorithm for the decomposition of
arbitrarily complex overlap sequences. This algorithm can extract
many times more information than previous methods and facilitates
the extracellular investigation of neuronal classes and of
interactions within neuronal circuits.},

abstract = {We demonstrate pronounced differences in the visual system of a polyphenic locust species that can change reversibly between two forms (phases), which vary in morphology and behavior. At low population densities, individuals of Schistocerca gregaria develop into the solitarious phase, are cryptic, and tend to avoid other locusts. At high densities, individuals develop instead into the swarm-forming gregarious phase. We analyzed in both phases the responses of an identified visual interneuron, the descending contralateral movement detector (DCMD), which responds to approaching objects. We demonstrate that habituation of DCMD is fivefold stronger in solitarious locusts. In both phases, the mean time of peak firing relative to the time to collision nevertheless occurs with a similar characteristic delay after an approaching object reaches a particular angular extent on the retina. Variation in the time of peak firing is greater in solitarious locusts, which have lower firing rates. Threshold angle and delay are therefore conserved despite changes in habituation or behavioral phase state. The different rates of habituation should contribute to different predator escape strategies or flight control for locusts living either in a swarm or as isolated individuals. For example, increased variability in the habituated responses of solitarious locusts should render their escape behaviors less predictable. Relative resistance to habituation in gregarious locusts should permit the continued responsiveness required to avoid colliding with other locusts in a swarm. These results will permit us to analyze neuronal plasticity in a model system with a well-defined and controllable behavioral context.},

abstract = {No dendritic spikes occur in the input fan of the lobular giant movement detector (LGMD) neurone. The action potentials are initiated at the point of thickening of the axon, which therefore represents the site of convergence of the retinotopic projection in the MD system. Previous work has shown that the site of decrement in response to repetitive visual stimulation is distal to this point. No change in spiking threshold in the LGMD could be demonstrated, and decrement in the number of LGMD action potentials is completely explained by the observed decrement of EPSPs recorded in the LGMD input dendritic fan. Possible postsynaptic mechanisms which might affect EPSP amplitude are excluded experimentally or shown to be improbable. Latency measurements during electrical stimulation in the second chiasma (which produces a decrementing EPSP in the fan) indicate that the pathway from the chiasma afferents to the LGMD fan is probably monosynaptic. By exclusion, the site of decrement appears to be located at the presynaptic terminal of that synapse. Generalization of habituation of the response to ON and OFF stimuli is demonstrated, showing that the presynaptic neurone at the labile synapse is an ON/OFF unit. The greater part of the previously described sensitivity gradient on the retina, relative to the MD response, appears to be explicable by the geometry of the LGMD fan and of the retinotopic projection. We conclude that the LGMD is fed by a homogeneous population of ON/OFF units running in the second optic chiasma, which form labile synapses on the input fan.},

abstract = {To demonstrate the role of proprioceptive feedback in aimed limb movements, we induced graded changes in the signals provided by the principal receptor in a leg of a locust. The femoro-tibial chordotonal organ (FCO) of the hindleg monitors extension and flexion movements of the tibia and provides the main source of proprioceptive feedback about tibial kinematics. The FCO apodeme (tendon) was surgically shortened by different amounts to provide a systematic bias to this feedback, and aimed scratching movements were analyzed over the week after surgery. Shortening the apodeme led to increased firing of sensory neurons of the FCO at flexed joint angles and is thus functionally similar to flexing the tibia. Immediately after surgery, limb movements shifted dorsally and posteriorly, driven by overextension of the femoro-tibial joint and changes at other joints of the limb. The extent of tibial overextension reflected the extent of apodeme shortening. Overextension would tend to renormalize the FCO feedback signal and can be explained by known interjoint reflex pathways. Our data demonstrate that proprioceptive feedback provides a graded signal that is used to control these aimed limb movements. Over the course of 7 d after surgery, there was a functional recovery in aiming as the overall patterns of movement returned toward control values driven by reciprocal compensatory changes at two joints. The sensory to motor pathways are monosynaptic and oligosynaptic in this system, thus providing us with a powerful opportunity to investigate further the sensorimotor transformations and plasticity of aimed limb movements.},

abstract = {Limb movements that are aimed toward tactile stimuli of the body provide a powerful paradigm with which to study the transformation of motor activity into context-dependent action. We relate the activity of excitatory motor neurons of the locust femoro-tibial joint to the consequent kinematics of hind leg movements made during aimed scratching. There is posture-dependence of motor neuron activity, which is stronger in large amplitude (putative fast) than in small (putative slow and intermediate) motor neurons. We relate this posture dependency to biomechanical aspects of the musculo-skeletal system and explain the occurrence of passive tibial movements that occur in the absence of agonistic motor activity. There is little recorded co-activation of antagonistic tibial extensor and flexor motor neurons, and there is differential recruitment of proximal and distal flexor motor neurons. Large-amplitude motor neurons are often recruited soon after a switch in joint movement direction. Motor bursts containing large-amplitude spikes exhibit high spike rates of small-amplitude motor neurons. The fast extensor tibiae neuron, when recruited, exhibits a pattern of activity quite different to that seen during kicking, jumping, or righting: there is no co-activation of flexor motor neurons and no full tibial flexion. Changes in femoro-tibial joint angle and angular velocity are most strongly dependent on variations in the number of motor neuron spikes and the duration of motor bursts rather than on firing frequency. Our data demonstrate how aimed scratching movements result from interactions between biomechanical features of the musculo-skeletal system and patterns of motor neuron recruitment.},

We show that this excitatory projection activates calcium-permeable nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In vivo calcium imaging reveals that the excitatory projection preserves retinotopy down to the level of a single ommatidium. Examining the impact of retinotopy on the LGMD's computational properties, we show that sublinear synaptic summation can explain orientation preference in this cell. Exploring retinotopy's impact on directional selectivity leads us to infer that the excitatory input to the LGMD is intrinsically directionally selective. Our results show that precise retinotopy has implications for the dendritic integration of visual information in a single neuron.},

We investigated whether the LGMD's receptive field for local motion stimuli can be explained by its electrotonic structure and the eye's anisotropic sampling of visual space. Five locust (Schistocerca americana) LGMD neurons were stained and reconstructed. We show that the excitatory dendritic field and eye can be fitted by ellipsoids having similar geometries. A passive compartmental model fit to electrophysiological data was used to demonstrate that the LGMD is not electrotonically compact. We derived a spike rate to membrane potential transform using intracellular recordings under visual stimulation, allowing direct comparison between experimental and simulated receptive field properties. By assuming a retinotopic mapping giving equal weight to each ommatidium and equally spaced synapses, the model reproduced the experimental data along the eye equator, though it failed to reproduce the receptive field along the ventral-dorsal axis.

The lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) responds preferentially to objects approaching on a collision course with the locust. Using calcium imaging, pharmacology and modeling, we show that spike frequency adaptation in the LGMD is mediated by a Ca(2+)-dependent potassium conductance closely resembling those associated with 'small-conductance' (SK) channels. Intracellular block of this conductance minimally affected the LGMD's response to approaching stimuli, but substantially increased its response to translating ones. Thus, spike frequency adaptation contributes to the neuron's tuning by selectively decreasing its responses to nonpreferred stimuli.

abstract = {1. The "descending contralateral movement detector" (DCMD) neuron in the locust has been challenged with a variety of moving stimuli, including scenes from a film (Star Wars), moving disks, and images generated by computer. The neuron responds well to any rapid movement. For a dark object moving along a straight path at a uniform velocity, the DCMD gives the strongest response when the object travels directly toward the eye, and the weakest when the object travels away from the eye. Instead of expressing selectivity for movements of small rather than large objects, the DCMD responds preferentially to approaching objects. 2. The neuron shows a clear selectivity for approach over recession for a variety of sizes and velocities of movement both of real objects and in simulated movements. When a disk that subtends > or = 5 degrees at the eye approaches the eye, there are two peaks in spike rate: one immediately after the start of movement; and a second that builds up during the approach. When a disk recedes from the eye, there is a single peak in response as the movement starts. There is a good correlation between spike rate and angular acceleration of the edges of the image over the eye. 3. When an object approaches from a distance sufficient for it to subtend less than one interommatidial angle at the start of its approach, there is a single peak in response. The DCMD tracks the approach, and, if the object moves at 1 m/s or faster, the spike rate increases throughout the duration of object movement. The size of the response depends on the speed of approach. 4. It is unlikely that the DCMD encodes the time to collision accurately, because the response depends on the size as well as the velocity of an approaching object. 5. Wide-field movements suppress the response to an approaching object. The suppression varies with the temporal frequency of the background pattern. 6. Over a wide range of contrasts of object against background, the DCMD gives a stronger response to approaching than to receding objects. For low contrasts, the selectivity is greater for objects that are darker than the background than for objects that are lighter.},

We have used the lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) and its postsynaptic target, the descending contralateral movement detector (DCMD), which are visual interneurons that detect looming objects, to analyze how differences in the visual ecology of the two phases are served by altered neuronal function. Solitarious locusts had larger eyes and a greater degree of binocular overlap than those of gregarious locusts. The receptive field to looming stimuli had a large central region of nearly equal response spanning 120 degrees x 60 degrees in both phases. The DCMDs of gregarious locusts responded more strongly than solitarious locusts and had a small caudolateral focus of even further sensitivity. More peripherally, the response was reduced in both phases, particularly ventrally, with gregarious locusts showing greater proportional decrease. Gregarious locusts showed less habituation to repeated looming stimuli along the eye equator than did solitarious locusts. By contrast, in other parts of the receptive field the degree of habituation was similar in both phases. The receptive field organization to looming stimuli contrasts strongly with the receptive field organization of the same neurons to nonlooming local-motion stimuli, which show much more pronounced regional variation. The DCMDs of both gregarious and solitarious locusts are able to detect approaching objects from across a wide expanse of visual space, but phase-specific changes in the spatiotemporal receptive field are linked to lifestyle changes.},

Gregarious locust DCMDs produced more action potentials and had higher firing frequencies, but individual postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) elicited in FETi were half the amplitude of those in solitarious locusts. A model suggested that this alone could not explain the similarity in overall amplitude, and we show that facilitation increased the maximum compound PSP amplitude in gregarious animals. There was the same linear relationship between times of peak DCMD firing before collision and the size/velocity of looming objects in both phases. The DCMD-FETi synapse transformed this relationship nonlinearly, such that peak amplitudes of compound PSPs occurred disproportionately earlier for smaller/faster objects. Furthermore, the peak PSP amplitude occurred earlier in gregarious than in solitarious locusts, indicating a differential tuning. Homeostatic modulation of the amplitude, together with a nonlinear synaptic transformation of timing, acted together to tune the DCMD-FETi system so that swarming gregarious locusts respond earlier to small moving objects, such as conspecifics, than solitarious locusts.},

abstract = {Desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) can undergo a profound transformation between solitarious and gregarious forms, which involves widespread changes in behaviour, physiology and morphology. This phase change is triggered by the presence or absence of other locusts and occurs over a timescale ranging from hours, for some behaviours to change, to generations, for full morphological transformation. The neuro-hormonal mechanisms that drive and accompany phase change in either direction remain unknown. We have used high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to compare amounts of 13 different potential neurotransmitters and/or neuromodulators in the central nervous systems of final instar locust nymphs undergoing phase transition and between long-term solitarious and gregarious adults. Long-term gregarious and solitarious locust nymphs differed in 11 of the 13 substances analysed: eight increased in both the brain and thoracic nerve cord (including glutamate, GABA, dopamine and serotonin), whereas three decreased (acetylcholine, tyramine and citrulline). Adult locusts of both extreme phases were similarly different. Isolating larval gregarious locusts led to rapid changes in seven chemicals equal to or even exceeding the differences seen between long-term solitarious and gregarious animals. Crowding larval solitarious locusts led to rapid changes in six chemicals towards gregarious values within the first 4 h (by which time gregarious behaviours are already being expressed), before returning to nearer long-term solitarious values 24 h later. Serotonin in the thoracic ganglia, however, did not follow this trend, but showed a ninefold increase after a 4 h period of crowding. After crowding solitarious nymphs for a whole larval stadium, the amounts of all chemicals, except octopamine, were similar to those of long-term gregarious locusts. Our data show that changes in levels of neuroactive substances are widespread in the central nervous system and reflect the time course of behavioural and physiological phase change.},

abstract = {1. The response of the movement detector (MD) system to proportionally constant incremental and decremental stimuli has been studied at various degrees of light and dark adaptation. Action potentials in the descending contralateral movement detector neurone were taken as the indicator of response. 2. Over a range of at least six log10 units of adapting luminance, the MD system behaves as an ON/OFF unit, giving responses to both incremental and decremental changes in the illumination of a 5 degrees target. 3. With increasing amplitudes of stimuli, both the ON and OFF responses saturate rapidly. Saturation is reached sooner at higher levels of light adaptation. At all levels of light adaptation, the OFF response is greater than the ON. The ratio for saturating stimuli is approximately constant at around 3:2. 4. At the brightest adapting luminances used (20 000 cd/m2) the ON response is reduced but not lost. At the lowest (0-004 cd/m2) the OFF response to a 5 degrees disc fails, but can be regained by increasing the test area to 10 degrees. 5. From what is known of the retina of locusts and other insects, it is thought that light and dark adaptation in the MD system can be adequately explained by events at the retinula cell.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Integrative neuroscience research needs a scalable informatics framework that enables semantic integration of diverse types of neuroscience data. This paper describes the use of the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and other Semantic Web technologies for the representation and integration of molecular-level data provided by several of SenseLab suite of neuroscience databases. METHODS: Based on the original database structure, we semi-automatically translated the databases into OWL ontologies with manual addition of semantic enrichment. The SenseLab ontologies are extensively linked to other biomedical Semantic Web resources, including the Subcellular Anatomy Ontology, Brain Architecture Management System, the Gene Ontology, BIRNLex and UniProt. The SenseLab ontologies have also been mapped to the Basic Formal Ontology and Relation Ontology, which helps ease interoperability with many other existing and future biomedical ontologies for the Semantic Web. In addition, approaches to representing contradictory research statements are described. The SenseLab ontologies are designed for use on the Semantic Web that enables their integration into a growing collection of biomedical information resources. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that our approach can yield significant potential benefits and that the Semantic Web is rapidly becoming mature enough to realize its anticipated promises. The ontologies are available online at http://neuroweb.med.yale.edu/senselab/.},

@article{Ventura2009,
abstract = {Much of neuroscience has to do with relating neural activity and behavior or environment. One common measure of this relationship is the firing rates of neurons as functions of behavioral or environmental parameters, often called tuning functions and receptive fields. Firing rates are estimated from the spike trains of neurons recorded by electrodes implanted in the brain. Individual neurons' spike trains are not typically readily available, because the signal collected at an electrode is often a mixture of activities from different neurons and noise. Extracting individual neurons' spike trains from voltage signals, which is known as spike sorting, is one of the most important data analysis problems in neuroscience, because it has to be undertaken prior to any analysis of neurophysiological data in which more than one neuron is believed to be recorded on a single electrode. All current spike-sorting methods consist of clustering the characteristic spike waveforms of neurons. The sequence of first spike sorting based on waveforms, then estimating tuning functions, has long been the accepted way to proceed. Here, we argue that the covariates that modulate tuning functions also contain information about spike identities, and that if tuning information is ignored for spike sorting, the resulting tuning function estimates are biased and inconsistent, unless spikes can be classified with perfect accuracy. This means, for example, that the commonly used peristimulus time histogram is a biased estimate of the firing rate of a neuron that is not perfectly isolated. We further argue that the correct conceptual way to view the problem out is to note that spike sorting provides information about rate estimation and vice versa, so that the two relationships should be considered simultaneously rather than sequentially. Indeed we show that when spike sorting and tuning-curve estimation are performed in parallel, unbiased estimates of tuning curves can be recovered even from imperfectly sorted neurons.},

@article{Zakotnik2004,
abstract = {We have developed and evaluated a new optical motion capture approach that is suitable for a wide range of studies in neuroethology and motor control. Based on the stochastic search algorithm of Simulated Annealing (SA), it utilizes a kinematic body model that includes joint angle constraints to reconstruct posture from an arbitrary number of views. Rather than tracking marker trajectories in time, the algorithm minimizes an error function that compares predicted model projections to the recorded views. Thus, each video-frame is analyzed independently from other frames, enabling the system to recover from incorrectly analyzed postures. The system works with standard computer and video equipment. Its accuracy is evaluated using videos of animated locust leg movements, recorded by two orthogonal views. The resulting joint angle RMS errors range between 0.7 degrees and 4.9 degrees, limited by the pixel resolution of the digital video. 3D-movement reconstruction is possible even from a single view. In a real experimental application, stick insect walking sequences are analyzed with leg joint angle deviations between 0.5 degrees and 3.0 degrees. This robust and accurate performance is reached in spite of marker fusions and occlusions, simply by exploiting the natural constraints imposed by a kinematic chain and a known experimental setup.},
